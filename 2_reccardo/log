Every data point is associated with a weight. The weight is given by
wt = E0 / (E0 + dE), where dE is the energy of that point relative to
the minium. E0 is a user-specified parameter (in unit Hartree).
Please specify the E0 you would like to use:
100000

a0 is a parameter (in unit Bohr) that is used when converting the
internuclear distances to the Morse variables y = exp(-r / a0).
Please specify the a0 you would like to use (Enter "0" to use the default
value 2.5, and we recommend that a0 between 2.0 and 3.0):
0
