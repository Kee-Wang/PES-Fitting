(1) Go to "emsa" directory, and compile the source code

(2) Copy the executable "msa" to the current directory

(3) ./msa [max order] [molecule type]
    for example: ./msa 5 2 2 1

(4) Run postemsa.pl: ./postemsa.pl 5 2 2 1
    you'll get bemsa.f90

    and ./derivative.pl 5 2 2 1
    you'll get dbemsa.90 (useful for analytical gradient)

(5) Modify the fit.f90 code properly:
    (a) number of atoms
    (b) number of data points
    (c) number of coefficients (bemsa.f90 tells the number of coeff.)
    (d) a0 value

(6) Compile the fitting code by typing:
    make fit.x

(7) The pts.dat file contains the geometries and the corresponding energies
    first line is the number of atoms
    second line is the energy in Hartree
    all the following lines are the Cartesian coordinates in Angstrom
    (The order of the atoms must agree with A2B2C)

(8) Run the fitting code: ./fit.x
    All the coefficients will be in "coeff.dat"

(9) Modify the pes_shell.f90 and getpot.f90 properly:
    (a) pes_shell.f90: number of coefficients, number of monomials
    (b) getpot.f90: number of atoms

(10) Compile the getpot:
     make getpot.x

(11) Run the test: ./getpot.x test.xyz
     The ab initio energy, PES energy (in Hartree) and the difference (in cm-1) will be in test.eng
     The finite difference gradient and analytical gradient will be in test.grd.
