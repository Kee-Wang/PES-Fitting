(8) Run the fitting code: ./fit.x
    All the coefficients will be in "coeff.dat"

(9) Modify the pes_shell.f90 and getpot.f90 properly:
    (a) pes_shell.f90: number of coefficients, number of monomials
    (b) getpot.f90: number of atoms

(10) Compile the getpot:
     make getpot.x

(11) Run the test: ./getpot.x test.xyz
     The ab initio energy, PES energy (in Hartree) and the difference (in cm-1) will be in test.eng
     The finite difference gradient and analytical gradient will be in test.grd.
