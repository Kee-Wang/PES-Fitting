Dear Xiaohong

I have sent the latest MM5.1.4 to 'bowman8' under user 'carter' in directory:
STUART/MM5.1.4.    You must only use files *.f and NEVER any *.F files.
Also there are two further directories /C2H4 and /METHANOL which contain
everything to repeat my largest tests (.....INC=10).   The input files 'fort.1.VCI.PERT'
in each directory are for the largest tests.   You will notice two changes to the input.
NBF,MBF,NVF,MVF replaces NBF,MBF,NVF.   The new parameter MVF is the number
of HEG points required (I have merely substituted MVF for the number calculated by
the original algorithm).  The new Lanczos parameter LANINC is the number of equal 'chunks'
required to calculate the rectangular matrix B (please ask Joel to run through my notes
with you to explain the matrices A,B,B',C' as I no longer have them).

The idea of the new method is to do Lanczos + perturbation theory more efficiently, by
only calculating what is finally required.   In this way, matrices order 3,000,000 can be
done in these tests since the final matrices are only order 30,000 or so.

There is still a small problem but this can be overcome by ensuring that LAN20 is always
less than the size of the 1- and 2- mode matrix.

Happy diagonalising!
Stuart
