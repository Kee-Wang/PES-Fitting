                               USER-GUIDE
                               ----------

This documentation is in two parts.  Part A is an outline of new features
present in `multimode.4.9.0' which have been introduced since `multimode.3.4',
and a knowledge of `multimode.3.4' is therefore assumed.  Part B is an outline
of the test program directories accompanying this release.  Throughout this and
the User-interface document USER.DOC, it is recommended that the Input document
INPUT.DOC is referred to for the meanings of key input parameters.  In this
document, new features are referred to by the relevant input parameters that
control them.


Part A - New Features of `multimode.4.9.0'
------------------------------------------

1.  ICOUPL: It is now possible to extend the mode-coupling of the potential to 
six (6) modes.

2.  ICOUPC: It is now possible to have a different mode-coupling for the
coriolis terms than that for the potential.  For large(ish) systems, the
`multi-mode' coupling becomes relatively more important for the potential than
for the coriolis terms.  ICOUPC = 0,...,ICOUPL are the allowed ranges of the 
new parameter ICOUPC which can be used to verify this for the case under
investigation.  Much computing time and space can be saved by minimising the
value of ICOUPC, particularly for high values of ICOUPL.   Currently, the
maximum value of ICOUPC = 4.

3.  INORM:  It is sometimes necessary to centre the Principal Axes on a
transition state, rather than at equilibrium (cf ammonia, where the coordinate
origin is the planar transition state).  Unless otherwise indicated, the
normal mode analysis will assume that the first (lowest) six eigenvalues and
eigenvectors are associated with the three translations and three rotations.
For such an analysis performed at a saddle point there will be at least one
imaginary frequency, and this situation is indicated by setting INORM < 0.

4.  NMAX:   The maximum mode-coupling of the VCI basis has been extended to 5
(see also MAXSUM and MAXBAS).

5.  NCONT:  In `multimode.3.4' the composition of the VCI basis is governed by
the three sets of parameters NMAX, MAXSUM and MAXBAS.  The parameters MAXBAS
are mode-dependent, whereas NMAX and MAXSUM are common to all modes.  In order
to allow more flexibility into the construction of the VCI basis, a new
parameter NCONT has been introduced into `multimode.4.9.0'.  This parameter
allows the total number of modes (NMODE=3N-6) to be split into a maximum of
two groups (say low-frequency and high-frequency).  For this purpose NCONT=-2
must be used (the facility with NCONT=+2 will be introduced in a future release
of `multimode.4.9').  The actual modes selected for each `scheme' is input in
ICONT and JCONT.  ICONT is the number of modes in each scheme, and JCONT is the
actual modes, labelled by the normal mode analysis (INORM>0, INORM<0) or input 
by the user (INORM=0).  Two individual VCI bases are set up in the standard
way, and therefore a set of parameters MAXSUM must be input for each scheme.
These two basis sets are then combined to form one complete VCI basis which
covers the entire NMODE modes.  (A future release with NCONT=+2 will carry out
a VCI on each scheme in turn, and collect the number of eigenfunctions given
by NVAL1 and NVAL2.  These will then be re-combined in a conventional
contraction scheme analysis).  Since `multimode.4.9.0' only fully supports the
case NCONT=-2 (or the original single scheme with NCONT=1), only a single VCI 
is carried out, and only NVAL1 is required.  This is equivalent to ISFCI>0, and
will override any setting of ISCFCI if set non-zero.  If NVAL1=0, the number of
eigenfunctions specified by ISCFCI will be used.

6.  MODINT: Since integration is carried out numerically, time and space can be
saved in cases where symmetry exists, by only integrating over half of the
total range of modes which do not transform as the totally symmetric
irreducible representation of the point group of the molecule under 
investigation.  If symmetry other than C1 is indicated by NVSYM, then the
modes corresponding to such asymmetric irreducible representations (labelled by
ISYM) should be echoed in MODINT with a value of MODINT(MODE)=2.  All totally 
symmetric modes should be given the value MODINT(MODE)=1.

7.  MEFF:   Sometimes (see INORM<0) the origin of the normal coordinates is not
on the minimum of the potential, and the preliminary one-dimensional 
contraction of the primitive harmonic-oscillator basis will take place with all
coordinates except the one under contraction set to zero.  This means that the
contractions may take place at a saddle point.  Since the quantisation of the
global potential will ultimately refer to the equilibrium (minimum) of the
potential, it is desirable to contract the basis with respect to an `effective'
potential which `sees' the effect of the global minimum.  For example, if the
imaginary frequency in ammonia is labelled as mode number one (1), the values
of MEFF(MODE) for MODE>1 to be given the values MEFF(MODE)=1, with MEFF(1)=0.
This will result in the one-dimensional potential for mode MODE>1, for each
point Q(MODE), being minimised with respect to the complete range of MODE=1.

8.  NVSYM:  It is now possible to extend the number of irreducible
representations to eight (8).  This is for pseudo D2h symmetry, where a centre
of symmetry is added to C2v; hence the species A1g, A1u, ... etc. are all
allowed.

9.  LAN20:  For very large VCI matrices, it is probably most convenient to
use the Davidson-Liu (Lanczos-like) iteration diagonalisation (see NCYCLE). 
There is sometimes a problem with such diagonalisations, depending on the
operating system (eg Linux before Mark 8), in that the maximum file-size
allowed is 2GB.  To attempt to overcome this, the Lanczos files can be spread
over 5 disc files by setting the parameter LAN20 to the maximum size of a
single disc file < 2GB.  A further function of this parameter is to allow the
diagonalisation procedure (for a single symmetry species, see MVSYM) to be
restarted if any problems occur with the installation etc.   Providing that
the message `Calculating Lanczos' has appeared on `fort.2', it is safe to kill
the job and restart setting LAN20 = -LAN20.  All files created during the job
with LAN20 > 0 will have to be saved so that they can be re-read during the job
with LAN20 < 0.

10. SYMBOL:  This input has been introduced to interface with abinitio packages
when using the `Direct Dynamics' facility (see MOLPRO below).  The NATOM atomic
symbols are input in the order used in the Normal coordinates that has been
chosen by the user.  This parameter is ALWAYS required.

11. XTANPM:  This input has been introduced to assist in the fitting of M-mode
grids when using the `Direct Dynamics' facility (see MOLPRO below).  For each
of the 3N-6 normal modes, a parameter XTANPM(MODE) is input such that, if the
extreme Gauss quadrature point is G(max) = -G(-max), a variable Y is defined
as Y = gamma.Q (Q is a mass-weighted normal coordinate), such that 
Y = XTANPM(MODE) at Q = G(max).  The variable tanh(Y) is then used in the
potential.  This parameter behaves like a Morse function at large displacements
and the input parameter XTANPM(MODE) sets the asymptotic value.  In most cases,
a value XTANPM(MODE) = 1.0 will be appropriate, but this can be varied if
required.

12. MOLINC:  This input has been introduced for the new `Direct Dynamics' 
facility (see MOLPRO below).  Its allowed values are 1 & 2, and is used to
stipulate the number of HEG integration points used to generate M-mode grids
which are used to define the points at which abinitio calculations are
required.  MOLINC = 1 implies that every HEG point will be used, whilst
MOLINC = 2 implies every other HEG point will be used.

13. MOLPRO:  This is the key parameter in the new `Direct Dynamics' feature of
`multimode.4.9.0'.  The method of M-mode coupling offers a solution to the
problem of generating global potentials for large molecules.  If, for example,
3-mode coupling is all that is required, then only 1-mode, 2-mode amd 3-mode
grids of the potential are required....anything greater than this will never be
used, and therefore need not be constructed.  Potentials are invariably 
obtained these days from abinitio packages such as `Molpro', and files can be 
produced to interface with such abinitio packages.  The abinitio data are then 
fed back into `multimode.4.9.0' to produce the required M-mode grids.  There
are two possible ways of creating potentials corresponding to these grids.  The
first way is to fit the abinitio data to a polynomial form (MOLPRO > 0) and
then use these fits to generate the potential along these grids, as required.
The second way is to store potentials and first derivatives at the M-mode grid
points, and then to use a Hermite interpolation in order to generate the
potential, as required.  As an aside, it is even possible to re-determine a
potential which already exists in functional form (it may contain `wiggles' or 
some other feature that requires `smoothing out').

But assume that it is required to investigate the spectroscopy of a molecule
for which nothing is known.  The following procedure can be adopted to fit the
various M-mode grids.  The first thing that must be done is to obtain the
position of the equilibrium structure abinitio, and then to carry out a
standard Wilson FG Normal Coordinate analysis within the abinitio package.  The
`fort.1' data file for `multimode.4.9.0' is then set up with IWHICH = 0,
ISCFCI < 0, INORM = 0 and NPOT = 3N-6.  The normal coordinate harmonic
potential (3N-6 values of omega) is then input as IPOT, JPOT, CPOT, together
with the parameters SYMBOL, XM, X0 and XL (see INPUT.DOC), where XL are the
mass-weighted displacement vectors arising from the Wilson FG analysis.  Now
set ICOUPL = ICOUPC = 1 and MOLPRO = 1 and run.  A file `fort.4' will be 
produced with a series of cartesian geometries (Angstroms), corresponding to 
one-mode Gauss quadrature grids; in particular, a line of `**********' will 
appear for each geometry.  This line must be replaced by a line containing a 
single value of the abinitio energy (all other lines must remain intact) and 
the new file must be transferred to `fort.3'.  Now amend `fort.1' by setting 
MOLPRO = 2 and re-run.  A file `fort.4' will again be produced, but this time 
it will contain the fitted one-mode potentials in the order required by 
`multimode.4.9.0' (the number of Gauss quadrature grid points generated in this
scheme will be fixed by the input parameter MBF).  This file, preceeded by a 
suitable single-record header such as C**ONE-DIMENSIONAL FITS should now be 
appended to the `fort.1' input file.

To continue with the fitting of two-mode grids, set ICOUPL = ICOUPC = 2,
MOLPRO = 3, and MOLINC = 1 if all HEG points are to be used to contruct the
grids, or MOLINC = 2 if alternate HEG points are to be used.  The number of
HEG points generated will be governed by NVF from the algorithm NVF+(MBF-NBF),
where (unlike `multimode.3.4') the number of points is always ensured to be
EVEN.  Then set MOLPRO = 4 and transfer `fort.4' to `fort.3', with the line of
`**********' replaced by abinitio energies and re-run to obtain the 2-mode
potentials.

This process is repeated for 3-mode and 4-mode potentials if required, noting
that the number of abinitio calculations will grow rapidly from 2-mode through
4-mode grids, and so careful manipulation of the number of HEG points (using
NVF and MOLINC) is suggested.

Full symmetry of the system is used such that no point will be generated twice,
so NVSYM and the remaining symmetry parameters should be set if appropriate.
This procedure can first be tested by the user on a molecule for which he has 
a global potential.   Such a test on the 6-mode molecule H2CS is supplied with
multimode.4.9.0' (see Part B below).

On completion of the fitting procedure, an enlarged `fort.1' will exist which
contains the potential parameters for the M-mode cuts appended in sequence.
In order to use these potentials, set up the remaining parameters required for
a VCI calculation with IWHICH < 0 (keeping MOLPRO > 0).  A complete sequence of
`fort.1' files is included in the test programs that accompany this release of 
multimode.4.9.0' which should act as a guide.

A related method can be performed, except that MOLPRO < 0 is set in the above
procedure.  This is the indication that the potential is to be interpolated
between grid points.  At the input of `fort.3' with `even' MOLPRO, not only is
the potential required, but the derivatives with respect to the mass-weighted
normal coordinates Q.  For an M-mode grid, the order of the first derivatives
in the input line `**********' is: V, dV/dQ(k), dV/dQ(l), dV/dQ(n), dV/dQ(m),
where k > l > n > m.  The actual modes are output to 'fort.3' to make sure that
the correct ordering can be guaranteed.  How the derivatives are obtained,
however, is another matter; it may be possible to obtain derivatives with
respect to x,y,z directly from the abinitio package, and then the normal
coordinate vectors can be used to convert these to derivatives with respect to
the Q.  Other ways might be to obtain the derivatives by finite differences in
the abinitio cycle, or even to fit the potentials to polynomials and then
differentiate these.  This method of `Direct Dynamics' is however more 
cumbersome than that described above for the M-mode fits, and should possibly 
be avoided.

14. IREACT:  This is the key parameter in the new `Reaction Path' feature of
`multimode.4.9.0'.  IREACT labels the torsional mode at the starting value of
`tau' (the Reaction Path coordinate) selected by the user.  This will be the
order of the torsional mode in a Wilson FG analysis performed at the starting
configuration.  If IREACT > 0, a global potential function must be supplied, 
and if IREACT < 0, files obtained from abinitio packages must be supplied.  For
IREACT > 0, two variants are available.  The first satisfies the Eckart 
conditions between successive points along the path, whilst the second uses 
successive geometries which are aligned along principal axes.  For IREACT < 0, 
the non-Eckart procedure is used.  For all `Reaction Path' studies, the user 
must provide a subroutine REACT (see USER.DOC).  If all `Reaction Path'
diagnostics are required, set IPRINT > 0, ISCFCI < 0.  This will stop after the
construction of the `Reaction Path', when the user can investigate the many
tests pertaining to the accuracy/validity of the path.  Once satisfied, set
IPRINT < 0  and ISCFCI > 0, plus the remaining parameters required for a 
conventional VCI run (see INPUT.DOC and RPH in Part B below).

Corresponding to the mode denoted by IREACT, the parameters NBF,MBF,NVF will
be set, bearing in mind the curvilinear nature of the `Reaction Path'
coordinate.  MBF = 90 or higher is usually sufficient for the number of
integration points spanning `tau' = 0 to 360 degrees.  NBF is the number of
primitive (both sin(n.tau) and cos(n.tau)), and something in the range 30 to 60
is reasonable.  The reason for so many torsional primitives is that convergence
along the `Reaction Path' is slow for such functions.

15. IDUMP:   This is the key parameter in the new `Dump & Restart' feature of
`multimode.4.9.0'.  The idea is to be able to carry out a vibrational analysis
and then to calculate properties relating to these vibrational wavefunctions.
Currently, this feature is not available for `Reaction Path' studies, but will
be introduced in a future release of `multimode.4.9'.  Furthermore, only the
evaluation of dipole moment matrix elements is available, but I welcome any
further suggestions that you may have for future implementation.  If IDUMP > 0,
then IDUMP VCI wavefunctions will be saved, as it is for these functions that
the property is to be calculated.  To calculate the dipole moment matrix
elements, the program can be restarted with LDUMP = 1.  The user must provide
a routine to evaluate the dipole moment components (as for the equivalent
routine for the potential);  if IWHICH > 0, the internal coordinate routines 
GETPOT (potential) and GETDIP (dipole) must be supplied.  If IWHICH < 0, the 
equivalent normal coordinate routines GETQPT (potential) and GETQDT (dipole) 
must be supplied.  The 'Dump & Restart' facility is not (yet) supported for
the black-box normal coordinate potential and dipole indicated by IWHICH = 0.
Dipole moment components are input in the sequence A1,B2,B1(A2) if C2v; A',A"
if Cs, etc..


Part B - Test Programs for `multimode.4.9.0'
--------------------------------------------

The test programs supplied with `multimode.4.9.0' are intended to augment those
supplied with `multimode.3.4' in such a way as to give examples of the majority
of features now at the user's disposal.  The new tests are grouped into five 
distinct directories H2CS, HOOH, FURAN, RPH and MOLPRO.

1.  H2CS:  This directory is mainly a hard copy of all allowed permutations
of the potential integration coupling (ICOUPL) and the Coriolis integration
coupling (ICOUPC) for standard VCI runs using a potential in internal
coordinates (IWHICH>0).  For all cases except ICOUPL=5 and ICOUPL=6, these 
tests include both J=0 and J=1.  The reason for this complete set is 
straightforward; should the user modify the code in any way (incorrectly), the 
test programs should be repeated, starting with ICOUPL=1, ICOUPC=0, followed by
ICOUPL=1, ICOUPC=1, etc. until such time that the results corresponding to the 
relevant `fort.2' file are no longer reproduced.  This may help in locating the
suspect routine.  The user is, however, NOT encouraged to make changes to the 
code in any way before prior consultations with myself.  All test input/output 
files which contain the word `test' are single-scheme (NCONT=1) VCI 
calculations, for which `fort.1.H2CS.test' is the master input file, set up 
with ICOUPL=4, ICOUPC=4, JMAX=0, EVLJ0=0.0.  These parameters alone need to be 
changed to run all the examples bearing the word `test'.  Standard `multimode'
is reported in Theor. Chem. Accts., 100, 191 (1998); J. Phys. Chem., A104, 
2443 (2000); Int. Rev. Phys. Chem., 22, 533 (2003) and references therein.

Two further tests are supplied which illustrate the `Dump & Restart' facility 
(see also FURAN below) for a potential and dipole in internal coordinates 
(IWHICH>0).  In `fort.1.H2CS.dump' IDUMP=20 indicates that 20 VCI wavefunctions
are to be saved for future use on `fort.60' whilst in `fort.1.H2CS.restart' 
dipole matrix elements between these functions are calculated by setting 
LDUMP=1 (the only LDUMP property supported to date).  In order to calculate the
three components of the dipole (A1, B2, B1) which will be integrated using the 
same integration points as those used to integrate the potential, a grid of 
geometries must be generated in the Eckart frame at which the X,Y,Z components 
of the dipole must be calculated and subsequently fit.  The input file 
`fort.1.H2CS.eckart' can be run to generate such a grid.  In theory, all 
displacements from the reference, which are determined by the normal coordinate
vectors should already be in the Eckart frame, but this may not be guaranteed 
due to rounding errors, etc. if external normal coordinates are input 
(INORM=0).  This feature is a safeguard against this occurring.  In 
`fort.1.H2CS.eckart', MDUMP=-4 is set to use 4 central (HEG) grid points and 
terminate after generating the Eckart frame grid.  Both cartesian coordinates 
and bond distances are given at each point in the grid.  The `Dump & Restart' 
tests are reported in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 3, 508 (2001).  A second 
`Dump & Restart' test is similar to the above, but the VCI basis is constructed
for two separate schemes (NCONT=-2) before recombination to give the required 
VCI basis which spans all 3N-6 modes.  Data for this test are in 
`fort.1.H2CS.-C.dump' and 'fort.1.H2CS.-C.restart'.  More information on
`Dump & Restart' can be obtained from IDUMP in Part A above.

For all tests, the USER.DOC routine `user.H2CS.F' is supplied.  USERIN reads 
all parameters necessary to evaluate the potential and dipole, whilst GETPOT 
and GETDIP calculate the instantaneous values of the potential and LDIP 
components of the dipole, respectively.  The remaining routines in 
`user.H2CS.F' are not used but must be present as dummy routines.  The 
potential (plus dipole) parameters are appended to `fort.1.H2CS.dump' and 
`fort.1.H2CS.restart', respectively.

2.  HOOH:  This directory is a hard copy of all allowed permutations of the 
potential integration coupling (ICOUPL) and the Coriolis integration coupling 
(ICOUPC) for `Reaction Path' VCI runs using a potential in internal coordinates 
(IWHICH>0).  For all cases, these tests include both J=0 and J=1.  The choice
of `Reaction Path' is that for which each point along the path, separated from
the previous point by a torsional (HOOH) angle of 0.5 degrees, satisfies the
Eckart conditions with respect to the previous point.  The parameter IREACT>0
points to the curvilinear mode number in a Wilson FG analysis at equilbrium.
The user-supplied routine `react.XXX.eckart.f' that is needed to generate such 
a path is detailed in USER.DOC (see also RPH below).  The routine `user.HOOH.F'
is supplied, which inputs all necessary parameters in USERIN, evaluates the 
potential energy using internal valence coordinates (IWHICH>0) in GETPOT, and 
determines the structure corresponding to the minimum energy for a given 
torsional angle in MINPOT.  The HOOH `Reaction Path' tests are reported in 
J. Chem. Phys., 113, 987 (2000) and Spectrochimica Acta, in press (2004) for 
J=0 and J=1, respectively.

3.  FURAN:  The test in this directory covers two new aspects of 
`multimode.4.9.0'.  The first is the use of potential (and dipole) functions,
created free-standing by the user in mass-weighted normal coordinates, denoted
by IWHICH<0 and MOLPRO=0 in `fort.1' (note that the choice of coordinate
Y=gamma.Q is not adopted in this test, although the parameters XTANH must be
input as dummy since IWHICH<0).  The second aspect covered by this test is the
`Dump & Restart' facility, and in `fort.1.FURAN.dump' the Dump facility is
initiated by setting IDUMP=20 to indicate 20 VCI wavefunctions will be saved
for future use on `fort.60'.  In `fort.1.FURAN.restart' the evaluation of
dipole matrix elements (the only property supported at the moment) is prompted
by LDUMP=1.  The relevant routines in USER.DOC are supplied in `user.FURAN.F'.
Routine USERIN inputs all parameters necessary to evaluate the potential and
dipole, whilst GETQPT evaluates the potential which has been constructed by
differentiation of an abinitio PES and converted to mass-weighted normal
coordinates as an independent exercise.   Similarly, the three components of
the dipole (A1, B2, B1) are evaluated in GETQDT, depending on the parameter
IDIP.  The remaining routines in `user.FURAN.F' are not used but must be 
present as dummy routines.  The potential (plus dipole) parameters are appended
to `fort.1.FURAN.dump' and `fort.1.FURAN.restart', respectively.  The FURAN
tests are reported in Spectrochimica Acta, A59, 1881 (2003) and Phys. Chem.
Chem. Phys., 6, 340 (2004).  More information on `Dump & Restart' can be
obtained from IDUMP in Part A above.

4.  RPH:  This directory contains tests for the three supported versions of the
`Reaction Path' facility, and is sub-divided into three further directories
(ECKART, NONECKART, ABINITIO).  

ECKART contains a test similar to those in HOOH above, and the user is also 
referred to that directory.  The benefit of satisfying the Eckart conditions 
between successive points along the path is that the successive structures form
a smoothly-varying path.  The (slight) drawback is that very small numerical 
errors become enlarged at points along the path as they become more distant 
from the starting point, and it may become necessary to `tidy up' a structure 
of high symmetry (for example for HOOH it is necessary to ensure that the `cis' 
and `trans' structures are strictly planar, due to the fact that the rotations 
required to obey successive Eckart conditions lead ultimately to slightly 
off-planar structures - the user can handle this difficulty as he/she feels 
fit, but it is pointed out here as something to beware of).  

NONECKART overcomes this difficulty in so far as successive points along the 
path are rotated to a principal axis coordinate system only.  In this case 
however, it can not be guaranteed that the coordinate systems for successive 
points along the path have not undergone axis-interchange due to over-rotation.
A test must therefore be included to ensure that the path remains smooth.  The 
user-supplied routine `react.XXX.noneckart.f' that is needed to generate such a
path is detailed in USER.DOC.

ABINITIO goes about the `Reaction Path' problem in a completely different way,
since now it is assumed that no potential is available for the molecule in
question.  In this sense, the approach is more one of `direct dynamics' in
which everything is evaluated by some abinitio package (GAUSSIAN, MOLPRO,..).
Specific data files must be generated corresponding to specific path points,
and therefore it is important to know the starting point of the path (usually
some high-symmetry structure such as `cis' or `trans') and the torsional
interval between successive points.  This process is outlined in detail for
`react.XXX.abinitio.f' in USER.DOC where the path is constructed as in 
NONECKART above.  The test example supplied is for a harmonic methanol 
potential, reported in Molec. Phys., 101, 3513 (2003), and the parameter
IREACT<0 points to the curvilinear mode in a Wilson FG analysis at equilibrium.

All test programs supplied in the RPH directories give full output (IPRINT>0) 
at each step during the development of the path (the determination of the path,
the derivatives of the path structures, the projection out of the `Reaction 
Path' coordinate, the derivatives of the 3N-7 normal coordinate vectors).  More
information on `Reaction Path' can be obtained from IREACT in Part A above, and
in the document USER.DOC.

5.  MOLPRO:  This directory contains tests for the construction of the M-mode
cuts of the potential, and is sub-divided into two further directories (FITS,
HERMITE).

FITS contains test data for fitting 1-mode to 5-mode cuts in the potential, by
mimicking an abinitio package with the use of an internal coordinate potential
(IWHICH>0).  The potential cuts produced at each stage are successively
appended to the various data files in `fort.1.H2CS.fit.M.V', where `M' is the
M-mode cut in question.  These fitted cuts are then used in evaluation of the
vibrational energy levels with `fort.1.H2CS.test.fit.V', where ICOUPL and
ICOUPC can be varied at the user's discretion (See Part A above).  The test
example supplied is reported in Chem. Phys. Lett., 352, 1 (2002).

HERMITE contains equivalent data for interpolation of the M-mode cuts of the
potential used in FITS above.   The interpolation data (potential plus first
derivatives) produced at each stage are successively appended to the various 
data files in `fort.1.H2CS.herm.M.V', where `M' is the M-mode cut in question.  
These cuts are then used in evaluation of the vibrational energy levels with 
`fort.1.H2CS.test.herm.V', where ICOUPL and ICOUPC can be varied at the user's
discretion (see Part A above).  The test example supplied is reported in Chem.
Phys. Lett., 342, 636 (2001).

More information on `Direct Dynamics' can be obtained from MOLPRO in Part A
above.  In particular, details on how to construct potential cuts from abinitio
data are given.
