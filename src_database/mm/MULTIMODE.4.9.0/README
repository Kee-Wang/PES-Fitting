MULTIMODE Version 4.9 Release 0
-------------------------------

MULTIMODE Version 4.9 will be issued in a series of releases.  Release 0 is 
contained in the current routines.

MULTIMODE Version 4.9.0 consists of:
blas.vscf.3.4.f
contr.vscf.4.9.0.f
curve.vscf.4.9.0.f
diag.vscf.4.9.0.f
drive.vscf.4.9.0.f
eckart.vscf.4.9.0.f
lanczos.vscf.4.9.0.f
lap.vscf.3.4.f
lib.vscf.3.4.f
matinv.vscf.2.3.f
memo.vscf.4.9.f
molpro.vscf.4.9.0.f
normal.vscf.4.9.0.f
projec.vscf.4.9.0.f
prop.vscf.4.9.0.f
react.vscf.abinitio.f
react.vscf.eckart.f
react.vscf.noneckart.f
rot.vscf.4.9.0.f
timit.vscf.2.3.f
user.vscf.4.9.0.f
vib.vscf.4.9.0.f

and the two directories DOCS and TESTS.  Directory DOCS consists of Manual
updates from MULTIMODE Version 3.4 issued earlier.  Directory TESTS is further
sub-divided into directories FURAN, H2CS, HOOH, MOLPRO, RPH containing test
input/output relating to specific features of MULTIMODE Version 4.9.0.  There 
are no external library routines required with MULTIMODE Version 4.9.0, but the
libraries 'blas' and 'lapack' can be replaced as required.

On most computers, compilation can be carried out with -O2 optimisation:
f77 -O2 -c XXXX.f;  however, on some SGI machines, -O1 should be used for
memo.vscf.4.9.f.  If -O2 has been used, and the results appear spurious,
first try the -O1 option for this module.  Users of Portland pgf77 or pgf90
will also find it necessary to use -O1 for lap.vscf.3.4.f if using the Reaction
Path facility.  There appear to be no problems if the standard 'lapack'
library is used.

An online Manual to MULTIMODE Version 4.9.0 is also supplied in three parts:

1...USER.DOC explains how the user must update the modules
memo.vscf.4.9.f, user.vscf.4.9.0.f and the potential routines (supplied here
as user.FURAN.f, user.H2CS.f, user.HOOH.f, user.CH3OH.f) for his personal use.

2...INPUT.DOC is a detailed description of the input data

3...GUIDE.DOC is a general description of the program with special reference to
new features within MULTIMODE Version 4.9.0, and to a series of test programs.

MULTIMODE Version 4.9.0 also comes with a variety of test input/output
files for use with supplied user-routines user.XXXX.f.  Each fort.1
file has been appended with the required 'user potential' required for the
particular test.

The tests are in the directories listed above, which also contain all potential
routines required to carry out the tests.  It is recommended that these
tests are first performed with the supplied data, by which time it should be 
clear to the user how to construct his or her own input files.
