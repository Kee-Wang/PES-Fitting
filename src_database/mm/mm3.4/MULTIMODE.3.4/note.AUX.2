Test AUX.2
----------
Tests the internal Normal Mode analysis facility.

Key input parameters
--------------------
INORM  > 0 forces `multimode' along the required route.
IWHICH > 0 indicates user-supplied potential in internal coordinates.
NPOT   = 0 (suggested `book-keeping' value...see below...parameter ignored)
ISCFCI < 0 terminates `multimode' on completion of the Normal Mode analysis.

Remarks
-------
In the majority of cases, the user will require `multimode' to carry out the
Normal Mode analysis that is required in order to facilitate the SCF/CI
procedures associated with the Watson hamiltonian.   In such cases, note that
the potential function MUST be given in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0) and
supplied by the user (see Manual for definitions of user-supplied routines
USERIN and GETPOT).  For potentials in internal coordinates, the parameter NPOT
is allocated by `multimode' to the number of Normal Modes of the system (see
Manual for the use of NATOM and NOTTR to define the number of modes), and is 
ignored on input, although an input value of NPOT = 0 is suggested...see below.

When using the Normal Mode facility (INORM > 0), the NPOT values of `omega'
input as IPOT,JPOT,CPOT are omitted from the input parameters.  Also, when
using the Normal Mode facility (INORM > 0), the NORMAL COORDINATE
DISPLACEMENTS are omitted from the input parameters.

In keeping with all AUX examples, ISCFCI < 0 is used to terminate `multimode'
after completion of the required procedure.  To continue with the correct
Normal Coordinates, set ISCFCI = 0 (for SCF) or > 0 (for CI).

If symmetry exists, it may be necessary to modify the Normal Mode vectors for
those whose absolute values should be equal.   This will usually entail
modifying the last few digits of the appropriate vectors in those given by
`multimode' to cancel rounndingg errors.  In this case, it will be necessary to
continue the calculations with INORM = 0.
