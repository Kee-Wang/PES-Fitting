Test SCFCI.1
----------
Tests the CI mixing of the fourty lowest-energy J=0 SCF states, using Normal
Modes determined by `multimode'.

Key input parameters
--------------------
ISCFCI > 0 forces `multimode' along the CI route.
INORM  > 0 indicates Normal Modes to be constructed by `multimode'.
NPOT   = 0 (suggested `book-keeping' value...see below...parameter ignored)
NSTAT  < 0 produces SCF calculations for |NSTAT| states.
ICI    > 0 selects SCFCI option.

Remarks
-------
The lowest 50 (NSTAT = -50) SCF hartree product functions are determined from
a knowledge of the values of `omega' resulting from the Normal Mode analysis
(INORM > 0).  The first 40 of these SCF states are then determined (ICI = 40) 
to a tolerance of CONV = 1.D-2 cm-1, for a maximum of ICOUPL = 3-mode coupling 
of the potential in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0).  These 40 states are
symmetry-blocked according to the symmetry parameters NVSYM,...,NSYM,...,MVSYM
and mixed by non-orthogonal CI.  The first 10 CI energies (ISCFCI = 10) of each
block are printed.

For potentials in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0), the parameter NPOT
is allocated by `multimode' to the number of Normal Modes of the system (see
Manual for the use of NATOM and NOTTR to define the number of modes), and is
ignored on input, although an input value of NPOT = 0 is suggested...see below.

When using the Normal Mode facility (INORM > 0), the NPOT values of `omega'
input as IPOT,JPOT,CPOT are omitted from the input parameters.  Also, when
using the Normal Mode facility (INORM > 0), the NORMAL COORDINATE
DISPLACEMENTS are omitted from the input parameters.
