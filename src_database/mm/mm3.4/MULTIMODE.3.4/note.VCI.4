Test VCI.4
----------
Tests the CI mixing of 1, 2, 3, 4 coupled modes in a selective virtual basis.

Key input parameters
--------------------
ICI    < 0 selects VCI option.
NMAX   < 0 constructs the selective CI basis.
MAXSUM     maximum sums of quanta for selective basis.
MAXBAS     maximum quanta for selective basis.

Remarks
-------
The VCI matrix is constructed from 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-mode coupled zpe virtual 
functions (NMAX = -4).  The maximum sum of quanta in the 1-mode basis is 4
(MAXSUM(1) = 4).  The maximum sum of quanta in the 2-mode basis is 5 (MAXSUM(2)
= 5).  The maximum sum of quanta in the 3-mode basis is 6 (MAXSUM(3) = 6). The
maximum sum of quanta in the 4-mode basis is 7 (MAXSUM(3) = 7).
For each mode, the maximum quantum in the 1-mode basis is 4 (MAXBAS(1,1) = ... 
= MAXBAS(NMODE,1) = 4).  For each mode, the maximum quantum in the 2-mode basis
is 3 (MAXBAS(1,2) = ... = MAXBAS(NMODE,2) = 3).  For each mode, the maximum 
quantum in the 3-mode basis is 2 (MAXBAS(1,3) = ... = MAXBAS(NMODE,3) = 2).
For each mode, the maximum quantum in the 4-mode basis is 1 (MAXBAS(1,4) = ...
= MAXBAS(NMODE,4) = 1).
