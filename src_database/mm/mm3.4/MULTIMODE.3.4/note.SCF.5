Test SCF.5
----------
Tests the calculation of ten default J=1 SCF states, using Normal Modes 
supplied by the user.

Key input parameters
--------------------
JMAX   = 1 indicates total angular momentum of J=1
ISCFCI = 0 forces `multimode' along the required SCF route.
INORM  = 0 indicates Normal Modes to be supplied by the user.
NPOT   = NMODE (suggested `book-keeping' value...see below...parameter ignored)
NSTAT  > 0 produces SCF calculations for NSTAT states (see also:
         SCF STATE DEFINITIONS below).

Remarks
-------
The 10 default (NSTAT = 10) SCF hartree product functions are determined from
a knowledge of the input parameters: SCF STATE DEFINITIONS.  The initial
parameter (= 0) indicates that NSTAT = 10 default representations are to be 
supplied as 10 records of 2 indices.  The first index is the number of quanta
in the mode given by the secondd index.  All remaining quanta are defaulted to
the value of the initial parameter (= 0).  These 10 J=0 and J=JMAX SCF states 
are then determined to a tolerance of CONV = 1.D-2 cm-1, for a maximum of 
ICOUPL = 3-mode coupling of the potential in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0).
The J > 0 energies are calculated by the `Adiabatic Rotation' approximation,
as explained in the Manual.

For potentials in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0), the parameter NPOT
is allocated by `multimode' to the number of Normal Modes of the system (see
Manual for the use of NATOM and NOTTR to define the number of modes (NMODE)), 
and is ignored on input.

When the Normal Modes are supplied by the user (INORM = 0), the NPOT values of 
`omega' input as IPOT,JPOT,CPOT are included in the input parameters.  Also, 
when the Normal Modes are supplied by the user (INORM = 0), the NORMAL 
COORDINATE DISPLACEMENTS are included in the input parameters.
