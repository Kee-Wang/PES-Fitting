Test VCI.2
----------
Tests the CI mixing of the three lowest quanta in each mode (unrestricted)
of the virtual basis for the SCF zpe level.

Key input parameters
--------------------
ISCFCI > 0 forces `multimode' along the CI route.
NSTAT  < 0 produces SCF calculations for lowest-energy |NSTAT| states.
ICI    < 0 selects VCI option.
NMAX   = 0 constructs the unrestricted VCI basis.

Remarks
-------
The lowest 50 (NSTAT = -50) SCF hartree product functions are determined from
a knowledge of the values of `omega' resulting from the Normal Mode analysis
(INORM > 0).  The virtual functions of ONLY the first (zpe) are used in the
ensuing VCI calculation (note: NSTAT = -1 produces an identical virtual basis).

The lowest 3 (ICI = -3) quanta (4 functions) of each 1-mode virtual basis are 
used to construct the unrestricted orthonormal CI basis (NMAX = 0).

The first test (2a) merely investigates the sizes of the CI symmetry blocks
resulting from this algorithm (MATSIZ > 0) and terminates.

The second test (2b) uses this basis in a VCI calculation (MATSIZ = 0).  The 
first 10 CI energies (ISCFCI = 10) of each block are printed, and the 
assignments include the states with the 2 largest CI coefficients (IPRINT = -2).
