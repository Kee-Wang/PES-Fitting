Test AUX.3
----------
Tests the facility to search for the minimum of the potential.

Key input parameters
--------------------
MCHECK < 0 forces `multimode' along the required route.
ISCFCI < 0 terminates `multimode' on completion of the minimum search.

Remarks
-------
For many molecules, the precise equilibrium geometry (potential minimum) may
not be known exactly.  The closer the input equilibrium geometry is to the
true minimum of the potential, the more accurate will be the results produced
by `multimode'.  The parameter MCHECK can be used to determine the required
coordinates.

AUX.3 is a test in 3 parts.
Part (a) is the starting position.  For the initial (trial) geometry, the
Normal Modes are produced (INORM > 0), and the Gauss quadrature points and
optimised HEG quadrature points are determined (see the Manual for NBF, MBF,
NVF).  The potential along each Normal Mode is inpected, in turn, and the
potential is fit to a quadratic polynomial, using the three central quadrature
points, from which the position of the minimum is found.  The minimum is 
shifted to Q = 0 (the minimum is defined such that all Q = 0).  The process is 
repeated with a cubic, quartic, pentic,... polynomial until all of the 
integration points are exhausted.  The principal axes associated with this
search are output by `multimode'.
Part (b) continues with the principal axes produced in part (a), as the
exact minimum was not quite found with the choice of integration points.
Part (c) does an SCF run (ISCFCI = 0) using the exact minimum of the potential
found in part (b), when it is now no longer necessary to search for the
potential minimum (MCHECK = 0).

In keeping with all AUX examples, ISCFCI < 0 is used to terminate `multimode'
after completion of the required procedure.  To continue with the correct
coordinates, set ISCFCI = 0 (for SCF) or > 0 (for CI), EITHER with the
most recent principle axis geometry given in the output from AUX.3 and with 
MCHECK = 0, OR with the previous input geometry to AUX.3 and with MCHECK < 0.

If symmetry exists, it is important that coordinates whose absolute values
should be equal are, in fact input such that this requirement is satisfied.
In most cases, this will entail modifying the last few digits in those given
by `multimode' in the transformed coordinates to cancel rounding errors.  In
this case, it will ultimately be necessary to continue the calculations with 
MCHECK = 0, as in case (c).
