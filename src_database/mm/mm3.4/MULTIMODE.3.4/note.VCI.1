Test VCI.1
----------
Tests the CI mixing of the three lowest quanta in each mode (restricted to a 
maximum sum of three quanta) of the virtual basis for the SCF zpe level.

Key input parameters
--------------------
ISCFCI > 0 forces `multimode' along the CI route.
NSTAT  < 0 produces SCF calculations for lowest-energy |NSTAT| states.
ICI    < 0 selects VCI option.
NMAX   > 0 constructs the sum-restricted VCI basis.

Remarks
-------
The lowest 50 (NSTAT = -50) SCF hartree product functions are determined from
a knowledge of the values of `omega' resulting from the Normal Mode analysis
(INORM > 0).  The virtual functions of ONLY the first (zpe) are used in the
ensuing VCI calculation (note: NSTAT = -1 produces an identical virtual basis).

The lowest 3 quanta (4 functions) of each 1-mode virtual basis are used to
construct the orthonormal CI basis (ICI = -3), subject to the constraint that
the total sum of quanta is not greater than 3 (NMAX = 3).  The first 10 CI 
energies (ISCFCI = 10) of each block are printed, and the assignments include
the states with the 2 largest CI coefficients (IPRINT = -2).
