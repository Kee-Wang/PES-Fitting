Test AUX.1
----------
Tests the transformation of the input equilibrium geometry to the principal
axis system, via the centre of mass coordinates.

Key input parameters
--------------------
MCHECK > 0 forces `multimode' along the required route.
ISCFCI < 0 terminates `multimode' on completion of the axis transformation.
NPOT   = NMODE (suggested `book-keeping' value...see below...parameter ignored)

Remarks
-------
For many molecules, the equilibrium cartesian coordinates are easiest to
determine if, for example, the origin is on an atom and one axis is along a
bond.   The parameter MCHECK can then be used to transform these coordinates
into the principal axis coordinates required by the Normal Coordinate
procedure within `multimode'.  

In keeping with all AUX examples, ISCFCI < 0 is used to terminate `multimode'
after completion of the required procedure.  To continue with the correct
coordinates, set ISCFCI = 0 (for SCF) or > 0 (for CI), EITHER with the
original input geometry and MCHECK > 0, OR with the principle axis geometry
given in the output from AUX.1 and with MCHECK = 0.

If symmetry exists, it is important that coordinates whose absolute values
should be equal are, in fact input such that this requirement is satisfied.
In most cases, this will entail modifying the last few digits in those given
by `multimode' in the transformed coordinates to cancel rounding errors.  In
this case, it will be necessary to continue the calculations with MCHECK = 0.

For potentials in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0), the parameter NPOT
is allocated by `multimode' to the number of Normal Modes of the system (see
Manual for the use of NATOM and NOTTR to define the number of modes (NMODE)),
and is ignored on input.

When the Normal Modes are supplied by the user (INORM = 0), the NPOT values of
`omega' input as IPOT,JPOT,CPOT are included in the input parameters.  Also,
when the Normal Modes are supplied by the user (INORM = 0), the NORMAL
COORDINATE DISPLACEMENTS are included in the input parameters.
