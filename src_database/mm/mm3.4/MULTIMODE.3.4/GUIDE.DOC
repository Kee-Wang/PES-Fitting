                               ----------

This Section describes in some detail the facilities offered by MULTIMODE.
It should be read in conjunction with the two Sections 'Input Parameters'
and 'Sample Inputs and Outputs'.   In the Section 'Input Parameters' all data
records are specified in full.   In the Section 'Sample Inputs and Outputs'
various facilities of MULTIMODE are tested, and in particular, key input
parameters are highlighted.   It will be seen that the test programs fall into
'five' basic categories:

1..AUX:  This category is mainly concerned with basic set-up facilities, in
particular, the features associated with the establishment of the Normal Modes.

2..SCF:  This category demonstrates how VSCF (Vibrational SCF) calculations
are performed.

3..SCFCI:  This category demonstrates how CI calculations can be performed 
using the (non-orthogonal) VSCF wavefunctions as a CI basis.

4..VCI:  This category demonstrates the use of (orthonormal) virtual zpe 
wavefunctions in near-variational CI calculations.

5..LAN:  This category demonstrates the use of an iterative diagonalisation
technique for use with very large VCI hamiltonian matrices.

Introduction
------------

In order to run MULTIMODE, the user must supply a subroutine which returns the 
value of the potential energy of his molecule for any arbitrary values of the 
cartesian coordinates of the atoms associated with the distortions from
equilibrium (see the Section 'User-Specific Routines').  It is advised that a
careful check of his routine is first carried out to establish the presence of
any spurious 'holes' which will play havoc with numerical integration of the
potential.   If his potential appears to be well-behaved, then the routines
USERIN and GETPOT can be compiled in his 'user.f' module.   

The next step is to choose a convenient size for the work array in the module 
'memo.f' (see the Section 'User-Specific Routines').  This is done by setting 
the size of MAXSIZ in the PARAMETER statement which appears in the first line 
of MAIN.  A recommended value is around 3000000.  The value given to MAXSIZ 
determines the size of the work array which is used to dynamically allocate 
memory.  If it is set too low, MULTIMODE will halt with a suggested alternative
value.   But remember; if it is set far too high, space will still be required 
on disc to hold unnecessary array space, and a exessive amount of memory will 
be sought.

Start with MAXSIZ as low as possible.   

Since GETPOT is called many times during a run of MULTIMODE, it is advised to 
use the highest possible level of optimisation supported by the FORTRAN compiler
when compiling 'user.f'.  Some SGI compilers produce incorrect results if 
'memo.f' is compiled at -O2, however, and we strongly recommend that the option
-O1 is used when compiling 'memo.f'.  All remaining modules can be compiled at 
the highest level of optimisation, and when all modules are linked, the user is
ready to start.  We recommend that he carries out test runs using the data files
given in the Section 'Sample Inputs and Outputs' and which are summarised below.
This will enable him to gain experience in setting up data files, as those in 
'Sample Inputs and Outputs' will have to be modified for use with his choice of
molecule.  The following categories have been designed to cover features that 
the user would naturally wish to address in order to gain familiarity with 
MULTIMODE.  The test examples are all for the 4-atom (NATOM = 4) molecule H2CS,
for which a potential in internal coordinates (IWHICH > 0) is supplied.  In all
cases, coupling of a maximum of three modes (ICOUPL = 3) in the potential and
coriolis terms is required.


Numerical Integration
---------------------

All integration of matrix elements is carried out numerically, using Gauss
hermite quadrature to integrate the NBF harmonic-oscillator primitives, 
followed by optimised HEG (Harris-Engerholm-Gwynn) quadrature to integrate the 
NVF contracted functions.   There is a Gauss rule which states that MBF points
will exactly integrate a polynomial of degree no greater than 2*MBF-1.  Hence,
if MBF = NBF+1, this will be sufficient to exactly integrate the overlap
matrix of the primitives.  In order to integrate a matrix element which
contains a potential term in (say) quartic would require the modified condition
MBF = NBF+3 and so on.  The user will be aware of the degree of his potential
and he would then set the difference MBF-NBF accordingly in his input data file.
These Gauss quadrature points are used to contract the basis, after which the
optimised HEG points are used.  If an SCF or SCFCI procedure is being undertaken
the number of contracted quanta are input directly as NVF.   If a VCI run is
being conducted, and the MAXBAS facility is being used (see INPUT.DOC), then
the value in NVF is overwritten by the maximum quantum required for the VCI
calculation in MAXBAS.   Whichever procedure is being used, however, the
algorithm used in order to establish the HEG integration points is as follows.
The integration of the contracted functions is assumed to follow the same
criteria as the integration of the primitives, namely that the excess of HEG
points to contracted functions is again MBF-NBF.  This means that there must
be sufficient primitives (NVF+MBF-NBF) in order to establish the required HEG
points, since these are formed from diagonalisation of the Q-expectation
value matrix in the NBF*NBF matrix of optimised functions (the contracted
functions are taken from the NVF lowest-energy subset of these optimised 
functions).   If these conditions are not met, MULTIMODE attempts to recover, 
from a knowledge of NVF and the excess MBF-NBF.

 
1. Basic Set-up Facilities (AUX)
--------------------------------

These test examples are mainly concerned with features relating to the Normal
Coordinates, and are terminated after initial tests have been performed by
setting ISCFCI < 0.  For these initial test examples, many of the input
parameters are ignored.  Only those relevant to the specific test under
discussion are highlighted below.

MULTIMODE Version 3.4 employs the Watson Normal Coordinate hamiltonian for 
non-linear molecules, and therefore requires an input equilibrium geometry in
cartesian coordinates, the harmonic force constants of the potential (omegas)
and the corresponding displacements of the atoms (the eigenvectors of FG).  It
could well be that the user knows all of these quantities, and wishes to use
them in a run of MULTIMODE.  Test program AUX.1 is such an example.  The user 
inputs the NUCLEAR MASSES and corresponding EQUILIBRIUM CARTESIAN COORDINATES,
and indicates to MULTIMODE that he wishes to use his own Normal Coordinates by
setting INORM = 0.  Since H2CS has six Normal Coordinales, he must input 
NPOT = 6 values of omega (in cm-1) as IPOT,JPOT,CPOT.  He must also input sets 
of NORMAL COORDINATE DISPLACEMENTS for each Normal Mode as x,y,z displacements
for each atom in turn.  Note: there MUST be consistency between the order of
the NUCLEAR MASSES, EQUILIBRIUM CARTESIAN COORDINATES, NORMAL COORDINATE
DISPLACEMENTS and the input omegas at IPOT,JPOT,CPOT.  It is most common when
running an FG analysis to choose a 'convenient' cartesian coordinate system to
describe the equilibrium configuration (one axis along a bond with an atom at
the origin is common).  The Watson hamiltonian, however, requires that the
input axes are the principal axes of rotation, and to instruct MULTIMODE to
find these from the input geometry, set MCHECK > 0.  In example AUX.1, the
molecule has been moved out of the yz plane on input to demonstrate this.  On
inspection of the output from AUX.1, it will be seen that the principal y and z
axes are correctly in the plane of the molecule.

In the vast majority of cases, the user will rely on MULTIMODE to carry out his
Normal Coordinate analysis.  In this case he sets INORM > 0.  There are now
NPOT = 0 values of omega to input at IPOT,JPOT,CPOT and the NORMAL COORDINATE
DISPLACEMENTS are omitted, as seen in test program AUX.2.

Finally, the user may have a potential function for which the precise position
of the equilibrium structure is not known exactly, but an approximate structure
is known.  To obtain the correct Normal Coordinates, the principal axes must 
correspond to the true equilibrium, and to get MULTIMODE to find it set
MCHECK < 0.  To find the true position of the minimum, use is made of the
integration points generated by the input parameters NBF,MBF,NVF.   These may
either be Gauss-hermite or optimised HEG points as described above in 
'Numerical Integration'.  For each mode, in turn, the position of the minimum 
is moved to Q=0 by first fitting the one-dimensional potential to a polynomial, 
using the three central integration points and finding the position of its 
minimum.  This process is repeated with five, seven,,... points until the 
integration points have been exhausted, in which case, the 'best' geometry is 
used to find the 'PRINCIPAL AXES COORDINATES'.  Test program AUX.3 is an example
of this, and is in three parts.  AUX.3a uses a modified (non-equilibrium) 
geometry as input, and inspection of the output reveals that, after fitting to 
the maximum-allowed eleven points, the true minimum has almost (but not quite) 
been found (the definition of the equilibrium is that Q=0 for all modes).  The 
'PRINCIPAL AXES COORDINATES' from AUX.3a are now used as input to AUX.3b.  
Because of symmetry, the new EQUILIBRIUM CARTESIAN COORDINATES have been 
'tidied' to give a totally-symmetric structure for H2CS.  This process must be 
repeated until the true equilibrium structure has been found, as is the case on
inspection of the output from AUX.3b, where Q=0 for all modes.  Once the true 
equilibrium has been found, the resulting 'PRINCIPAL AXES COORDINATES' are 
transferred to the input EQUILIBRIUM CARTESIAN COORDINATES, taking into 
consideration any strict symmetry requirements, and some other task can be 
performed by first setting MCHECK = 0.  In AUX.3b, for example, a VSCF job is 
submitted (ISCFCI = 0).


2. Vibrational Self-Consistent Field (SCF)
------------------------------------------

ISCFCI = 0 is the key parameter for VSCF calculations, and each state is
found to an energy tolerance given by CONV.  The SCF examples here are all to
CONV = 1.D-2 cm-1.  When any new system is being investigated, the potential
and coriolis terms must be established at the integration grids for all of the
coupled modes demanded by ICOUPL.  If ICOUPL > 0, REAL*8 grids are formed and
written to disc if IDISC = 0.  If disc space is short, REAL*4 grids can be
used by setting ICOUPL < 0.  For large systems, a large amount of time can be
spent writing these grids to disc, but, providing that the final Normal Modes
have been found (as in the AUX examples) and the optimum number of Gauss points
and/or HEG points determined by the parameters NBF,MBF,NVF have been determined,
these grids need only be written ONCE ONLY.  Thereafter, setting IDISC > 0 will
omit writing these grids, and use the existing ones already on disc.

When performing an SCF calculation, a discreet number of vibrational states
are found.   There are a variety of ways to indicate those states required.
The simplest way is merely to determine the lowest -NSTAT vibrational levels,
by setting NSTAT < 0.  In this case, there are no SCF STATE DEFINITIONS,  and 
use is made of the omegas to calculate the states required.  Test programs 
SCF.1 and SCF.2 are examples for which ten such states are found.  SCF.1 uses 
Normal Modes determined by MULTIMODE, and SCF.2 uses user-supplied Normal Modes.
If a more specific set of VSCF states are required, set NSTAT > 0 to indicate 
how many, and set the SCF STATE DEFINITION parameter.   Two types of setting are
supported.  The first, as in test program SCF.3, is initiated by setting the 
SCF STATE DEFINITION < 0.  This is followed by NSTAT records which define the
SPECIFIC STATES.  Each record consists of NMODE = 3*NATOM - 6 integers which 
signify the specific number of quanta in ALL the modes for all the NSTAT states
to be determined.  The second, as in test program SCF.4, first sets the SCF 
STATE DEFINITION to a default value (usually 0), and then inputs NSTAT-1 records
which indicate number of quanta in corresponding mode, respectively.  In test 
program SCF.4, all modes are given a default setting of 0 quanta (this is taken
to be the first VSCF state, in this case, the zero point level), and then the 
next six VSCF states have a single quantum in each of the six modes, 
respectively.  The final three states have two quanta in each of the first three
modes, respectively.   This default method is really only desirable for setting
up fundamentals and overtones.
 
Test programs SCF.1 to SCF.4 all determine the VSCF states for zero total
angular momentum (JMAX = 0).  Test program SCF.5 calculates J=0 and J=1 VSCF 
states by setting JMAX = 1;  J>0 energies for SCF states are obtained by using 
the adiabatic rotation approximation only.  Currently, all J > 0 levels are 
assigned according to asymmetric top definitions of Ka,Kc.


3. Non-orthogonal VSCF Functions in CI (SCFCI)
----------------------------------------------

ISCFCI > 0 is the key parameter for all CI calculations, and signifies the
number of vibrational (JMAX = 0) or rovibrational K-diagonal (JMAX > 0) energies
required, subject to the print cut-off parameter in CUT.   All CI energies are
printed in cm-1 relative to the base energy given in EVLJ0, which is usually
set to zero for J=0 calculations.  In this case, the energies are printed out
relative to the J=0 zero point.  For J>0 calculations, EVLJ0 is usually input
as the absolute zero point energy for J=0.  In all the following examples, ten
CI energies are required (ISCFCI = 10) subject to a cut-off of 1.0D+4 cm-1, and
only the leading CI coefficient is given in a medium print output (IPRINT = 2).
An SCFCI calculation is indicated by setting ICI > 0, and this is the number of
VSCF states to mix in the non-orthogonal CI basis.

In test program SCFCI.1, a J=0 calculation is performed (JMAX = 0) for the
lowest fifty SCF states (NSTAT = -50), of which the first fourty are used to 
form the CI basis (ICI = 40).  These basis functions are symmetry-blocked, since
the vibrations of H2CS span four C2v species (NVSYM = 4), resulting from 
combinations of the three distinct mode vibrations (NWSYM = 3).  There are
three A1 modes (NSYM = 3; ISYM = 3 4 5), two B2 modes (NSYM = 2; ISYM = 1 6) and
one B1 mode (NSYM = 1; ISYM = 2).  ISYM indicates the specific mode and can be
obtained from inspection of the Normal Mode displacement vectors.   All four 
symmetry blocks are required (MVSYM = 4; MWSYM = 1 2 3 4).  MWSYM indicates 
which specific species are required, in this example all of them.  All CI 
enegies are given relative to the J=0 zero point (EVLJ0 = 0).

Test programs SCFCI.2 and SCFCI.3 perform the same task, namely an initial
VSCF run for J=0 and J=1 (JMAX = 1) followed by an SCFCI calculation using the
lowest twenty VSCF functions as basis (ICI = 20).  The J > 0 calculations all
make use of the adiabatic rotation approximation.  The only difference between
the two runs is that SCFCI.2 uses REAL*8 disc grids (ICOUPL = 3) and SCFCI.3
uses REAL*4 disc grids (ICOUPL = -3).  All CI energies are given relative to the
J=0 zero point energy obtained from the output of test program SCFCI.1 
(EVLJ0 = 5375.4543), which is obtained from the first (A1) CI block.


4. Orthonormal Virtual zpe Functions in CI (VCI)
------------------------------------------------

This is the most exact algorithm in the MULTIMODE package, and is initiated
by setting ISCFCI > 0 (as above), and ICI < 0.  If NMAX > 0 or NMAX = 0, then
-ICI means the maximum quantum of excitation (in ALL modes) in the VCI basis.
If NMAX > 0, the VCI basis is restricted to a sum of quanta of NMAX.  Test
program VCI.1 is such an example.  Each individual mode basis function can have
up to three quanta of excitation (ICI = -3), but the total hartree product CI
expansion function is only allowed a total sum of three quanta (NMAX = 3).  As
in the SCFCI test programs, the resulting CI matrix is symmetry-blocked.  It
will be noticed that the parameter NSTAT = -50, from earlier tests.  Recall that
this means that the lowest fifty VSCF states would be determined in an SCF run
of MULTIMODE, starting with the zero point level.  The fact that a VCI run is in
progress curtails the VSCF procedure after the initial state has been 
determined, and the zpe virtual functions are therefore used in the VCI.  If, 
for some reason, the user thinks that some other VSCF would be more appropriate
for his VCI basis, he should use the NSTAT > 0 facility (see SCF above), and 
input his preferred choice of VSCF state as the initial SPECIFIC STATE.  There
is a research facility for VCI calculations (ICI < 0) whereby it is possible
to dump information about wavefunctions to a disc file for further scrutiny,
for example the study of transition moments, etc..  This facility is not yet
released, but is controlled by the parameter IDUMP.  For the time being the
user should set IDUMP = 0.

If NMAX = 0, the VCI basis is unrestricted, but this may lead to extremely
large CI matrices, especially as the number of modes increases.  It is advised
to first run a job with MATSIZ > 0.  This merely instructs MULTIMODE to work
out the matrix size(s) and then STOP.   If they appear to be manageable, he
can continue by running the same data set with MATSIZ = 0.  Test programs
VCI.2a and VCI.2b do this.   As a matter of interest, it will be noticed from
the output of VCI.2a that six modes excited to a maximum of three quanta without
restriction (NATOM = 4, ICI = -3, NMAX = 0), combine to give four CI matrices 
each of size 1024, even when utilising full C2v symmetry, so beware!
