MULTIMODE Version 3.4 Release
-----------------------------

MULTIMODE Version 3.4 consists of:
blas.vscf.3.4.f
diag.vscf.3.4.f
drive.vscf.3.4.f
lanczos.vscf.3.4.f
lap.vscf.3.4.f
lib.vscf.3.4.f
matinv.vscf.2.3.f
memo.vscf.3.4.f
normal.vscf.2.3.f
rot.vscf.3.4.f
timit.vscf.2.3.f
user.vscf.3.4.f
vib.vscf.3.4.f

and the routine user.H2CS.3.4.f for test purposes.  There are no external
library routines required with MULTIMODE Version 3.4.

On most computers, compilation can be carried out with -O2 optimisation:
f77 -O2 -c XXXX.f;  however, on some SGI machines, -O1 should be used for
memo.vscf.3.4.f.  If -O2 has been used, and the results appear spurious,
first try the -O1 option for this module.

An online Manual to MULTIMODE Version 3.4 is also supplied in three parts:

1...USER.DOC explains how the user must update the modules
memo.vscf.3.4.f, user.vscf.3.4.f and the potential routine (supplied here
as user.H2CS.3.4.f) for his personal use.

2...INPUT.DOC is a detailed description of the input data

3...GUIDE.DOC is a general description of the program with reference to
a series of test programs (below).

MULTIMODE Version 3.4 also comes with a variety of test input/output
files for use with the supplied routine user.H2CS.3.4.f.  Each fort.1
file must be appended with the supplied 'user potential' h2cs.pot.

It is recommended that these tests are first performed with the supplied
data, by which time it should be clear to the user how to construct his
own input files.
