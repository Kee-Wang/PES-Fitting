This code uses microcanonical sampling to distribute the energy randomly to the cartesian velocities.  You basically just
need to input the configuration and total kinetic energy you want to give to the molecule.

You will need to make a few changes to dynam-oct09.f90 so this will work with your PES.

1)  Line 279 in dynam-oct09.f90:  change nk to the number of atoms in your system.
2)  Line 671 in dynam-oct09.f90:  change nk to the number of atoms in your system.
3)  Line 26 and Line 38 in sub.f90:  change nk to the number of atoms in your system.
4)  Replace "prepot" with "pes_init", and "calcpot(v,x)" with v=f(x). This code uses old pes_shell, and 'prepot' and 'calcpot' are the subroutines that initialize and calculate the potential in the old pes_shell
